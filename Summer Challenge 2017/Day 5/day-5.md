# Day 5: Work Assets, App Settings, and Yet More Customization

You've made it to the last day!  Today we will:

* Learn a little bit about the standard assets.
* Check out the Asset Store.
* Finish the final customizations of our game.

## The Standard Assets

Making your own models, materials, and scripts is all well and good, but Unity actually comes with some standard assets that you can use to get up and running faster.  Want to create a driving game?  There is a standard car asset that you can use to prototype your idea first before putting a lot of time into custom creating vehicles.  Rather make a flying game?  There is a standard airplane too.

The assets that you can import are much more complex than we have time to cover.  Included are the geometry, materials, and textures, but also scripts for user input, animation, and even AI.  Let's import some standard assets.

1. Select the **Assets** menu and then hover over the **Import Package** menu item.

2. Let's select **Assets->Import Package->Vehicles**.

3. A window will pop up so that you can select the components that you want.  We'll just keep all of the assets that are included so click the **Import** button.

4. The assets will be imported into your **Assets** folder down in the project view.

Go ahead and look around at what assets are included.

## The Asset Store

One of the most powerful aspects of using Unity for developing your projects is that there is a thriving community of users and developers willing to offer their own creations for you to buy or use.  Unity has made this even easier by providing an asset store where you can find (and/or purchase) assets for your projects.  Here's how you access and use the asset store.

1. Above the scene view there is an **Asset Store** tab, click it.

2. There are many filters that you can set before you search for assets.  Today we'll only be looking at free assets so start there.

3. Next, you can search for particular types of assets like characters or vehicles.

4. Once you've found an interesting asset and selected it, you can preview the package contents to get an idea of what it contains.

5. If the asset looks good you can then click the download button.  A window will then popup so that you can import the asset directly into your project.

## Finishing Up

Our final step to finish up is going to be to set a title and icon for the game so that it looks nice and professional on your phone.

1. Go to the player settings.

2. In the **Company Name** setting type in a fun name for your company.

3. Similarly, in the **Product Name** setting type in the name you'd like your game to show up with on your phone.

4. Now that we know how to make simple textures, you can use a program to draw an icon, or go get one from the internet.

5. Put your new icon texture image in the **Default Icon** setting.

6. Rebuild and deploy!  You should see the changes on your phone when you go to select your game to play.

## Don't Stop Here!

Keep on customizing and tweaking your game as much as you want!  Find new assets, learn about other aspects of using Unity like particle effects or advanced physics.  Your imagination is your only limitation!
